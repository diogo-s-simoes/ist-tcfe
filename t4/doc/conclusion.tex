\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of building an audio amplifier was achieved.
 The cost of the circuit was of $ 2102.508 MU$ and the merit $3.238$.
 
The results from both the theoretical analysis using octave and the circuit
simulation using ngspice appear to roughly match, as we can see in the following figure and table:

We can see that the gain for the second stage is fairly different. The simulation has a drop at around $10^6$ Hz, while the theoretical model mantains steadily at around 45dB.

Comparing all of the other values, we get the following table:

We can compare directly the input impendance for stage 1, Zi1: The theoretical model gives a lower value, about $86\%$ of the simulated one. Same goes for the output impedance, Zo2, where the theoretical analysis gives $\approx 0.3$, which is only around $3\%$ of what the simulation gives.

\par
We can conclude that there are various differences between the theoretical and simulation analysis. These can be attributed to the various aproximations
made in the theoretical analysis, in the ideal transistor model for example, while the simulation uses a comparatively accurate spice model. The simulation therefore gives more credible values, closer to reality.
