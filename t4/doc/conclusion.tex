\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of building an audio amplifier was achieved.
 The cost of the circuit was of $ MU$.
 
The results from both the theoretical analysis using octave and the circuit
simulation using ngspice appear to match, as we can see in the following table:

The differences of both methods of analysis can be attributed to the various aproximations
made in the theoretical analysis, where as the simulation uses the comparatively accurate spice model.
