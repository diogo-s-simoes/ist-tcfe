\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of building an audio amplifier was achieved.
 The cost of the circuit was of $ MU$.
 
The results from both the theoretical analysis using octave and the circuit
simulation using ngspice appear to match.

The differences of both methods of analysis can be attributed to the various aproximations
made in the theoretical analysis, where as the simulation uses the comparatively accurate spice model.
