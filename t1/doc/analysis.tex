\section{Theoretical Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

In this section, the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:t1} is analysed
theoretically.

\section{Time response}

The circuit consists of a single V-R-C loop where a current $i(t)$ circulates. The
voltage source $v_I(t)$ drives its input, and the output voltage $v_O(t)$ is taken from
the capacitor terminals. Applying the Kirchhoff Voltage Law (KVL), a single
equation for the single loop in the circuit can be written as



The forced solution is of the form given in Equatiand is
illustrated in Fi

\begin{equation}
  V_{Of}(t) = |\bar{V}_{Of}| cos(\omega t + \angle \bar{V}_{Of}),
  \label{eq:vo_for}
\end{equation}
