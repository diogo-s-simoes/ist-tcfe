\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a static DC circuit has been
achieved. A static analysis has been performed on the circuit, through both the
node analysis and mesh analysis methods, using the Octave software, and a simulation
was run using ngspice.
The three sets of results all match with all available decimal places of precision.
The reason for this perfect match is the fact that although this circuit has multiple
components and nodes, all of the components are linear, and no time dependence exists.
The matching of results for the various methods also helps to confirm the accuracy of the equations
used for the theoretical analysis.
