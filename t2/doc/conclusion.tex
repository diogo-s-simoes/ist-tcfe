\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing both the static solution
of a circuit with fixed applied voltage and a capacitor, and the time-dependent solution
of the same circuit has been successful.
The results from both the theoretical analysis using octave and the circuit
simulation using ngspice appear to match, for both the static analyses for $t<0$ and
for the calculation of boundary conditions, and for the natural, forced, and frequency responses.
