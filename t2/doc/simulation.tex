\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:p1} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
at times $t<0$.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/p1_tab.tex}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:p1}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:p2} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
given that $V_s=0$ and replacing the capacitor with a
voltage source imposing the voltage on the terminals of said capacitor
as calculated in the earlier analysis.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
      \hline    
      {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
      \input{../sim/p2_tab.tex}
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Operating point. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
      and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
      Volt.}
    \label{tab:p2}
  \end{table}
This is necessary so as to provide initial conditions for the analyses made below given
that $V_s$ at time $t=0$ is equal to 0 but the voltage difference in the terminals of the
capacitor stays constant for very short time intervals.
\subsection{Natural response}

We will now use the values of $V(6)$ and $V(8)$ calculated above as initial conditions
for a transient analyisis of the natural response of the circuit when $V_s=0$.
This is represented in figure \ref{fig:t2}

  \begin{figure}[H] \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../sim/trans3.pdf}
    \caption{Natural Response}
    \label{fig:p3}
    \end{figure}

  \subsection{Forced response}

 Utilizing the same initial conditions and the value for $V_s$ given for $t>0$,
 an analysis of the forced response of the circuit over time was performed.
This is represented in figure \ref{fig:t2}

  \begin{figure}[H] \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../sim/trans4.pdf}
    \caption{Forced Response}
    \label{fig:p4}
    \end{figure}

  \subsection{Frequency analysis}

Finally, the frequency response of the circuit was studied and the magnitude and phase
of both $V_s$ and $V(6)$ was plotted for values of $f$ from $0.1 Hz$ to $1 MHz$.

  \begin{figure}[H] \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../sim/mag5.pdf}
    \caption{Frequency Response - Magnitude}
    \label{fig:p5mag}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{figure}[H] \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../sim/phase5.pdf}
        \caption{Frequency Response - Magnitude}
        \label{fig:p5phase}
        \end{figure}

The magnitude of the voltage $V_s$ is always 1 (or 0 in dB), and its phase is always 0, by definition.
As we can see, the magnitude of $V(6)$ drops sharply between the orders of magnitude of $10^1$ to $10^3$,
stabilizing at a value of around $-4.9 dB$.
The phase starts off being close to 0, but deviates to negative values, stabilizing at $-\pi$.
