\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of building an AC/DC converter circuit by using a tranformer, envelope detetcor and a low-pass filter was achieved.
 The ripple has a value of $4.13*10^{-3} V$.
 The stabilization time was of around 1 second.
 The cost of the circuit was of $59.9448 MU$.
 The merit is therefore equal to $4.03825$
 
The results from both the theoretical analysis using octave and the circuit
simulation using ngspice appear to match as can be seen in the below comparison:
