\subsection{Envelope detector}

Table~\ref{tab:p1} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
at times $t<0$.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
   % \input{../sim/p1_tab.tex}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:p1}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:p2} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
given that $V_s=0$ and replacing the capacitor with a
voltage source imposing the voltage on the terminals of said capacitor
as calculated in the earlier analysis.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
      \hline    
      {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
   %   \input{../sim/p2_tab.tex}
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Operating point. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
      and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
      Volt.}
    \label{tab:p2}
  \end{table}
This is necessary so as to provide initial conditions for the analyses made below given
that $V_s$ at time $t=0$ is equal to 0 but the voltage difference in the terminals of the
capacitor stays constant for very short time intervals.
