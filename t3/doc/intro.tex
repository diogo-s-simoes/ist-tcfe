% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to build an AC/DC converter, with a transformer, envelope  detector and voltage regulator. The AC voltage of 230V and frequency 50Hz will be transformed into a DC voltage of 12V.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
