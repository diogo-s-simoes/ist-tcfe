\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:lab}

We were able to build the circuit presentially utilizing a breadboard and the various components.

Then, the frequency of the input voltage source was ajusted, from $50 Hz$ to $50 kHz$, at various increments and, for each value, the value of the output voltage was measured.
The results are in the following table:
